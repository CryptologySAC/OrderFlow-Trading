# AbsorptionDetector Optimization Summary for 0.7%+ Turning Points

## 📊 Current Production Analysis

**Current Configuration (config.json lines 255-287):**

- `minAggVolume`: 400 (zone aggregate volume)
- `windowMs`: 60000 (60 seconds)
- `zoneTicks`: 5 ($0.05 price zones)
- `absorptionThreshold`: 0.6
- `priceEfficiencyThreshold`: 0.02
- `eventCooldownMs`: 15000 (15 seconds)

## 🎯 Live Market Validation

**Recent Absorption Event Observed:**

- 3 large trades: 326 + 675 + 602 = **1,603 total zone volume**
- Pattern: Peak down that was absorbed
- Volume ratio: 1,603 is **4x** the current 400 threshold
- Result: Should have triggered absorption signal (if price efficiency criteria met)

## 🔬 Key Optimization Insights

### 1. Volume Threshold Analysis

- **Current 400**: Appropriate for major institutional flows
- **Alternative 250-300**: Would catch more medium-size absorption events
- **Alternative 800-1000**: Only major institutional events (like the 1,603 example)

### 2. Zone Size Impact

- **2-3 ticks ($0.02-0.03)**: More granular, catch precise turning points
- **4-5 ticks ($0.04-0.05)**: Current production, good for major levels
- **6+ ticks ($0.06+)**: Institutional-level absorption zones

### 3. Time Window Optimization

- **30-45s**: Faster response, catch quick reversals
- **60s**: Current production timing
- **75-90s**: More comprehensive pattern analysis

## 🏆 Recommended Optimization Configurations

### Configuration 1: High Sensitivity (More Signals)

```json
{
    "minAggVolume": 300,
    "windowMs": 45000,
    "zoneTicks": 3,
    "absorptionThreshold": 0.55,
    "priceEfficiencyThreshold": 0.015,
    "eventCooldownMs": 10000
}
```

**Expected**: 20-30% more signals than current, catch smaller absorption events

### Configuration 2: Balanced Precision (Recommended Start)

```json
{
    "minAggVolume": 350,
    "windowMs": 50000,
    "zoneTicks": 4,
    "absorptionThreshold": 0.58,
    "priceEfficiencyThreshold": 0.018,
    "eventCooldownMs": 12000
}
```

**Expected**: Slight increase in signals with maintained quality

### Configuration 3: Institutional Focus (Highest Quality)

```json
{
    "minAggVolume": 600,
    "windowMs": 75000,
    "zoneTicks": 6,
    "absorptionThreshold": 0.7,
    "priceEfficiencyThreshold": 0.025,
    "eventCooldownMs": 18000
}
```

**Expected**: Fewer signals, but highest confidence for major turning points

## 📈 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Validate Current Performance

1. **Monitor current detector** for absorption events like the 1,603 volume example
2. **Track detection rate** of actual 0.7%+ moves in live trading
3. **Measure false signal rate** and signal timing accuracy

### Phase 2: A/B Test Optimized Configurations

1. **Start with Balanced Precision** (safest improvement)
2. **Test High Sensitivity** if more signals needed
3. **Test Institutional Focus** if false signals are too high

### Phase 3: Fine-Tune Based on Results

1. **Adjust volume thresholds** based on market activity levels
2. **Optimize time windows** for different market conditions
3. **Refine absorption thresholds** for signal quality

## 🎯 Success Metrics for 0.7%+ Turning Points

### Primary Metrics

- **Detection Rate**: % of 0.7%+ moves with preceding absorption signals
- **False Signal Rate**: % of absorption signals NOT followed by 0.7%+ moves
- **Signal Timing**: Average time between signal and turning point

### Target Performance

- **Detection Rate**: >65%
- **False Signal Rate**: <25%
- **Direction Accuracy**: >70%
- **Average Move After Signal**: >0.7%

## 🔧 Parameter Impact Guide

### minAggVolume Impact

- **↓ Lower (250-350)**: More signals, catch smaller institutional flows
- **↑ Higher (500-800)**: Fewer signals, only major institutional events

### zoneTicks Impact

- **↓ Smaller (2-4)**: More granular detection, precise turning points
- **↑ Larger (5-7)**: Broader institutional levels, major absorption zones

### windowMs Impact

- **↓ Shorter (30-50s)**: Faster signals, catch quick reversals
- **↑ Longer (70-90s)**: More pattern context, stronger confirmation

### absorptionThreshold Impact

- **↓ Lower (0.5-0.58)**: More signals, lower quality filter
- **↑ Higher (0.65-0.75)**: Fewer signals, higher quality requirement

## 💡 Key Recommendations

### For 0.7%+ Turning Point Optimization:

1. **Start with balanced_precision configuration** - safest improvement path
2. **Monitor for events like the 1,603 volume absorption** - validate detection
3. **Focus on volume correlation** - larger absorption should predict larger moves
4. **Track signal-to-move timing** - optimize for early detection without false signals
5. **Consider market regime adaptation** - different settings for different volatility periods

### Critical Success Factors:

1. **Volume threshold** must be appropriate for market activity levels
2. **Zone size** must match institutional trading patterns
3. **Time window** must capture complete absorption events
4. **Price efficiency filtering** prevents false signals in trending markets
5. **Cooldown periods** prevent signal spam from same absorption event

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement balanced_precision configuration** in testing environment
2. **Monitor live absorption events** for validation (like the 1,603 example)
3. **Track performance metrics** over 1-2 week period
4. **Adjust parameters** based on actual detection rate and false signal rate
5. **Scale to live trading** once optimized configuration is validated
