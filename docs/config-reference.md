# Config.json Reference Guide

## Overview

This document describes every setting available in `config.json`. Each option controls how the OrderFlow Trading application connects to data streams, processes order book information and manages trading signals. The examples below are based on the default `config.json` shipped with the repository.

## Notes on Tweaking Values

Lowering thresholds (like `minAggVolume` or `threshold`) generally produces more signals but with higher noise. Increasing cooldowns and confirmation requirements results in fewer, higher‑quality alerts at the expense of responsiveness. Each trading pair may require tuning to balance sensitivity and false positives.

## 🔧 Threshold Configuration Improvements (2025-06-23)

**Key Enhancement**: All detector threshold parameters are now **fully configurable** through `config.json`, eliminating previously hardcoded values that could block signal generation.

### Critical Fixes Applied

**AbsorptionDetector**:

- `priceEfficiencyThreshold` (was hardcoded at 0.7, now configurable with default 0.85)

**ExhaustionDetector**:

- `imbalanceHighThreshold`, `imbalanceMediumThreshold` (were hardcoded at 0.8, 0.6)
- `spreadHighThreshold`, `spreadMediumThreshold` (were hardcoded at 0.005, 0.002)

**DeltaCVDConfirmation**:

- `strongCorrelationThreshold`, `weakCorrelationThreshold` (were hardcoded at 0.8, 0.4)
- `depthImbalanceThreshold` (was hardcoded at 0.7)

**AccumulationZoneDetector**:

- `priceStabilityThreshold`, `strongZoneThreshold`, `weakZoneThreshold` (now configurable)

### Benefits

- **Eliminates "No Signals" Issues**: Hardcoded thresholds that blocked signals are now configurable
- **Backtesting Flexibility**: Different threshold combinations can be tested systematically
- **Production Optimization**: Optimal thresholds can be deployed from backtesting results
- **Institutional Compliance**: Full configuration auditability and repeatability
