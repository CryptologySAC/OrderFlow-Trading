## 📊 The 5 Main Detectors

### Priority Ranking (from config.json)

1. **Absorption Detector** (Priority: 10) - Highest
2. **Exhaustion Detector** (Priority: 9)
3. **DeltaCVD Detector** (Priority: 8)
4. **Accumulation Zone** (Priority: 7)
5. **Distribution Zone** (Priority: 7)

### 1. Absorption Detector 🛡️

**Purpose**: Identifies price levels where large orders are absorbed without breaking through

**Configuration**:

```json
{
    "minAggVolume": 100, // 100 LTC minimum
    "windowMs": 30000, // 30-second window
    "eventCooldownMs": 15000, // 15-second cooldown
    "absorptionThreshold": 0.4,
    "minPassiveMultiplier": 1.1
}
```

**Local High Signals**:

- Aggressive selling absorbed at resistance
- Price fails to break higher despite buying
- Bid liquidity depletes while asks strengthen

**Local Low Signals**:

- Aggressive buying absorbed at support
- Price fails to break lower despite selling
- Ask liquidity depletes while bids strengthen

### 2. Exhaustion Detector 💨

**Purpose**: Detects momentum failure and liquidity depletion patterns

**Configuration**:

```json
{
    "minAggVolume": 15, // 15 LTC minimum
    "windowMs": 45000, // 45-second window
    "eventCooldownMs": 5000, // 5-second cooldown
    "exhaustionThreshold": 0.05,
    "volumeSurgeMultiplier": 1.2
}
```

**Exhaustion Patterns**:

- **Volume Decay**: 60 → 45 → 30 → 20 → 15 LTC
- **Velocity Decay**: Trade frequency decreasing
- **Momentum Loss**: Each push weaker than previous

### 3. DeltaCVD Detector 📈

**Purpose**: Identifies divergences between price movement and cumulative volume delta

**Configuration**:

```json
{
    "windowsSec": [60, 180, 300], // Multi-timeframe: 1m, 3m, 5m
    "minVolPerSec": 10, // 10 LTC/second minimum
    "eventCooldownMs": 15000, // 15-second cooldown
    "cvdImbalanceThreshold": 0.2
}
```

**Divergence Types**:

- **Bearish**: Price up, CVD down → Local high
- **Bullish**: Price down, CVD up → Local low
- **Confirmation**: All timeframes align

### 4. Accumulation Zone Detector 📦

**Purpose**: Identifies zones where institutional buyers accumulate positions

**Configuration**:

```json
{
    "eventCooldownMs": 15000,
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.2,
    "accumulationVolumeThreshold": 3,
    "accumulationRatioThreshold": 0.45,
    "aggressiveBuyingRatioThreshold": 0.6
}
```

**Zone Characteristics**:

- Persistent buying pressure
- Buy ratio > 60% over 2+ minutes
- Multiple timeframe confluence
- Volume concentration at specific levels

### 5. Distribution Zone Detector 📉

**Purpose**: Identifies zones where institutional sellers distribute positions

**Configuration**:

```json
{
    "eventCooldownMs": 15000,
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.2,
    "distributionVolumeThreshold": 3,
    "distributionRatioThreshold": 0.4,
    "aggressiveSellingRatioThreshold": 0.6
}
```

**Zone Characteristics**:

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Signal Quality Metrics

Track these metrics to optimize strategy:

1. **Hit Rate by Detector Count**

    - 2 detectors: 65-70%
    - 3 detectors: 75-80%
    - 4 detectors: 85-90%

2. **Average Time to Target**

    - Local highs: 35-40 minutes

### Configuration Tuning

```bash
# Monitor signal quality
pm2 logs app | grep -E "signalConfirmed|confidence"

# Track detector alignment
pm2 logs app | grep -E "absorption.*exhaustion|cvd.*divergence"

# Analyze zone persistence
pm2 logs app | grep -E "zoneUpdate.*strength|accumulation.*confidence"
```

## 🎯 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Local High

```
T+0: Distribution zone forms at $87.50
T+15: Volume exhaustion pattern begins (45→30→20 LTC)
T+25: CVD turns negative despite price at $87.52
T+30: Absorption signal - sells absorbed at $87.53
→ ENTRY: Short at $87.52
T+45: Price drops to $87.15
→ EXIT: +0.42% profit
```

### Example 2: Strong Local Low

```
T+0: Accumulation zone at $86.80
T+20: Seller exhaustion detected
T+30: Positive CVD divergence
T+35: Buy absorption at $86.78
→ ENTRY: Long at $86.80
T+55: Price rises to $87.25
→ EXIT: +0.52% profit
```

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Maximum Risk Rules

1. **Per Trade Risk**: 0.3% maximum
2. **Daily Loss Limit**: 3 trades or 1%
3. **Correlation Risk**: No same-direction trades within 30 minutes

### Signal Filtering

Avoid trades when:

- Single detector only
- Conflicting signals present
- Recent stop loss hit (30-minute cooldown)
- Major news events pending

### Position Scaling

- Start with 40% on 2-detector signals
- Add 20% on each additional confirmation
- Never exceed 100% allocation

## 📈 Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Timeframe Confirmation

- 15-minute chart: Trend context
- 1-hour chart: Major levels

### Volume Profile Integration

- Identify high volume nodes
- Confirm zone locations
- Validate absorption levels

### Order Book Analysis

- Monitor bid/ask imbalances
