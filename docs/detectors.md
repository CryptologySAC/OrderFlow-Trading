# 🎛️ **Detector Interaction Strategy**

## **Primary Signal Generation:**

```
DeltaCVD (momentum) + Exhaustion (reversal) = Core signals
```

## **Confirmation Layer:**

```
Absorption (liquidity) + Distribution/Accumulation (zones) = Context
```

## **Risk Management:**

```
Enhanced Zone Formation = Market regime filter
```

# 🏆 **Why This Hierarchy Matters**

### **Signal Processing Priority:**

1. **DeltaCVD** fires first → immediate momentum detection
2. **Exhaustion** confirms reversal → counter-trend opportunity
3. **Zone detectors** provide context → confluence confirmation
4. **Enhanced zones** filter market regime → risk management

### **Resource Allocation:**

- **15%** on zone-based confirmations
- **5%** on strategic positioning (accumulation zones)

### **Performance Expectations:**

- **DeltaCVD**: 60-70% win rate, 1:1.5 R:R
- **Exhaustion**: 70-80% win rate, 1:2 R:R
- **Zone detectors**: 80-90% win rate, 1:3 R:R (fewer signals)
