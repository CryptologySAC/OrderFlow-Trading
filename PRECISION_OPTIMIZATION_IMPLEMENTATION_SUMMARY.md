- **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring of missed 0.7%+ opportunities
- **Action Plan**: Parameter relaxation if >20% valid signals missed

**Risk 2: Parameter Interaction Effects**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (multiple parameter changes simultaneously)
- **Mitigation**: Phased monitoring with ability to rollback individual changes
- **Action Plan**: A/B testing framework for parameter combinations

**Risk 3: Market Regime Changes**
- **Likelihood**: High (market conditions evolve)
- **Mitigation**: Monthly revalidation of parameter effectiveness
- **Action Plan**: Adaptive threshold adjustment based on rolling performance

### Emergency Rollback Plan

**If performance degrades significantly:**
1. **Backup Available**: `config_backup_YYYYMMDD.json` created
2. **Rollback Command**: `cp config_backup_YYYYMMDD.json config.json`
3. **Restart Required**: System restart to reload previous parameters
4. **Analysis Required**: Post-rollback analysis to identify failure cause
